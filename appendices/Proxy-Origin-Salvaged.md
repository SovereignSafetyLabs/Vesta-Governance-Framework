# Proxy Origin — Salvaged Concepts  
### Supplemental Theory From Early Gemini Drafts

This document archives high-value conceptual material from the “Proxy Origin” drafts.

---

# 1. Proxy as Constraint Interface

Gemini repeatedly framed the Proxy (early version of Kernel + Identity):

> “A Proxy is not an agent.  
> It is the boundary through which the agent must pass.”

This is exactly how:
- Sovereign Protocol  
- Kernel Identity  
work today.

# 2. Early Framing of Identity Integrity

> “The system may produce thoughts,  
> but it may not produce a new self.”

This concept survives into:
- Sovereign Stack v2.4.3  
- Kernel identity boundaries

# 3. The “Constraint Reservoir” Metaphor

Gemini described constraints as:

> “A reservoir that Tendrils draw from, but never drain.”

This is a clear analogy for:
- GCV (Global Constraint Vector)  
- constraint inheritance

# 4. Early Version of CLF

Gemini described CLF in simple language:

> “If you cannot show the chain, you cannot make the claim.”

This phrasing is excellent for future documentation.

---

# 5. Early Thoughts on State Transitions

Gemini described fallback states as:

- “cooling modes”  
- “lower energy layers”  

This predates your later thermodynamic framing.

---

# 6. Error Conditions

Gemini described ambiguities as:

> “Tears in the reasoning fabric.”

This imagery is actually technically useful when describing causal collapse.
