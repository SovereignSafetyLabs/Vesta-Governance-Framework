# Ghost Modules — Salvaged Concepts from Early Whitepaper Lineage  
### Keeper List, Retired List, and Future Versions

This document preserves concepts that appeared repeatedly in early drafts but were later removed. Some should be integrated into future versions of the Kernel; others are retired.

---

# 1. Keeper Ghost Modules (High Future Value)

## 1.1 Reflection Gate  
Concept:
- A checkpoint that verifies whether the model’s internal reasoning matches the Kernel’s constraints.

Why keep:
- Useful for v1.0 Kernel introspection.

---

## 1.2 Boundary Mirror  
Concept:
- A mechanism that tests whether the model has drifted from identity boundaries.

Why keep:
- Supports persona integrity in multi-agent contexts.

---

## 1.3 Recursive Sentinel  
Concept:
- A monitoring process that watches for recursion-based drift or instability.

Why keep:
- Important for long-horizon reasoning tasks.

---

## 1.4 Ideal Action Surface  
Concept:
- A topological model defining the “safe region” of possible inferences.

Why keep:
- Can formalize Vesta’s amplitude ceilings.

# 2. Unnecessary or Replaced Ghost Modules (Retire)

## 2.1 Sovereign Chamber  
Redundant with:
- Kernel identity  
- CLF lineage  
- Tendril initialization  

Retire for redundancy.

---

## 2.2 Deep Operator Mode  
Overly abstract, unclear interface.

Retire pending clearer definition.

---

## 2.3 Quantum Action Catalogue  
Conceptually interesting but not tied to actual safety needs.

Retire for now; may reappear in theoretical work.

---

# 3. Modules for Future Exploration (v2.0+)

## 3.1 Reasoning Horizon Model  
Defines how far reasoning *should* go for different task classes.  
Useful for advanced Vesta and Kernel versions.

---

## 3.2 Constraint Echo  
Idea that constraints propagate to sub-agents with diminishing amplitude.  
Potentially useful for multi-tier Tendril systems.
