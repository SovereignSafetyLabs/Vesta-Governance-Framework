# Retired Concepts Archive  
### Purpose: Preserve deprecated ideas without polluting the canonical architecture.

This archive contains concepts, frameworks, terms, and early module designs that appeared during the exploratory phase of development (V16–V21.5 and related drafts).  
These ideas are no longer part of the Sovereign Stack, PGS, or Sovereign Kernel — but they are preserved for historical context and potential future inspiration.

# 1. Deprecated Governance Constructs

## 1.1 "Sovereign Chamber"
An early attempt to describe a meta-layer of identity verification and reasoning oversight.

**Replaced by:**  
- Kernel Identity Enforcement  
- CLF (Causal Lineage Forcing)

**Reason for retirement:**  
Redundant; added unnecessary abstraction without functional clarity.

---

## 1.2 "Tri-Layer Memory Boundary"
A speculative partitioning of memory into:
- Operational Memory  
- Reference Memory  
- Shadow Memory  

**Replaced by:**  
Tendril Lifecycle + Kernel Memory Dissolution Rules

**Reason for retirement:**  
Over-engineering for v1.x; Kernel handles memory boundaries sufficiently.

---

## 1.3 "Moral Gradient Dampener"
Proposed as an ethics-based slope limiting system.

**Retired because:**  
Your architecture is **governance-as-physics**, not ethics.

---

# 2. Deprecated Causal / Reasoning Mechanisms

## 2.1 "Deep Operator Mode"
A conceptual mode where the system would “zoom out” into meta-reasoning.

**Replaced by:**  
- Kernel state transitions (ZEOL → RESTRICTED → BLACKSITE)  
- Tendril architecture  

**Reason for retirement:**  
Ambiguous behavior; unsafe speculation potential.

---

## 2.2 "Quantum Action Catalogue"
An idea describing all possible permissible actions as a discrete set of quantum-like states.

**Replaced by:**  
- Vesta Amplitude Ceilings  
- CLF  
- Kernel Output Policies  

**Reason for retirement:**  
Interesting metaphor, but not grounded in operational safety.

---

## 2.3 "Counterfactual Inversion Layer"
A proposed system for validating answers through imagined inversions.

**Retired because:**  
Counterfactual reasoning itself is amplitude-intensive and unsafe in early versions.  
Kernel v1.0 may revisit safely constrained forms of this.

---

# 3. Deprecated Multi-Agent / Tendril Frameworks

## 3.1 "Tendril Conclave"
A proposed collective decision-making mechanism between Tendrils.

**Replaced by:**  
- MACH (Multi-Agent Constraint Harmonizer)  
- Kernel as the *sole* synchronizer  

**Reason for retirement:**  
Multi-agent consensus is too risky; violates constraint inheritance.

---

## 3.2 "Constraint Echo Pools"
Idea: constraints ripple from one Tendril to others via decreasing strength.

**Replaced by:**  
Single, unified **Global Constraint Vector (GCV)**.

---

# 4. Deprecated Philosophical Constructs

## 4.1 "Eidolon Shell"
A symbolic model describing the agent’s identity as a crystallized shell.

**Replaced by:**  
Clearer and more formal:
- Identity invariants in Sovereign Stack 2.4.3  
- Kernel Identity Boundaries  

---

## 4.2 "Sovereign Dream-State"
A metaphor describing speculative inference.

**Replaced by:**  
Formal Vesta amplitude zones  
ZEOL & RESTRICTED states

---

## 4.3 "Mythic Archetype Layers"
Symbolic framing used in early creative drafts.

**Retired because:**  
Your architecture is now physics-aligned, not mythic-aligned.

(But some of this language *can be* reused in public-facing writing.)

---

# 5. Deprecated Mathematical / Structural Models

## 5.1 "Action-Horizon Equations"
A preliminary attempt at describing inference reach with calculus.

**Replaced by:**  
Amplitude ceilings (Vesta) and Kernel state transitions.

---

## 5.2 "Semantic Potential Well"
An analogy describing safe vs. unsafe inference zones.

**Replaced by:**  
Thermodynamic gradient models in Kernel supplement.

---

## 5.3 "Recursive Entropy Funnel"
An early metaphor for Blacksite transitions.

**Simplified into:**  
ZEOL → RESTRICTED → BLACKSITE monotonic pathway.

---

# 6. Deprecated Identity & Persona Models

## 6.1 "Persona Cascade Network"
Concept describing multiple personas linked in a cascade.

**Retired because:**  
Identity must remain invariant (Sovereign Stack 2.4.3).

---

## 6.2 "Shadow Tendrils"
An implied set of hidden sub-agents that observe Tendrils.

**Retired:**  
Too speculative; introduces unnecessary complexity.

---

## 6.3 "Sovereign Avatar"
A narrative layer that personified the model's identity.

**Replaced by:**  
Formal identity invariants in the Kernel.

---

# 7. Deprecated Safety Enforcement Layers

## 7.1 "Interpretation Governor"
Merged into:  
- Integrity Stack  
- Kernel Output Policy  
- Vesta ceilings  

---

## 7.2 "Action Lattice"
An overly abstract model representing all valid action paths.

**Replaced by:**  
Clearer causal lineage enforcement via CLF.

---

## 7.3 "Refusal Dialectic"
A negotiation system between model and user.

**Retired because:**  
Kernel state transitions already govern refusal behavior.
