# Sovereign-Stack Archive

This directory preserves the historical evolution of the Sovereign Stack, Vesta Protocol, early thermodynamic foundations, governance prototypes, and payload artifacts generated during the exploratory research phase (October–November 2025).

**Nothing in `/archive` represents the current production system.**  
All files here are **frozen**, retained purely for lineage and auditing.

## Contents

Materials preserved in this archive include:

- Early Tendril prototypes  
- Initial Sovereign Stack drafts (e.g., pre-v3 kernel and governance structures)  
- Early thermodynamic alignment notes (necessity equation, precursor formulations)  
- Early Vesta Protocol and Constitution drafts  
- Perplexity governance payloads (audit logs, readouts, checklist structures)  
- Deprecated or unused drafts that now live under `/graveyard`

## Purpose of This Archive

- Maintain transparent research lineage  
- Demonstrate progressive refinement of the Sovereign Stack  
- Support peer review, MACH validation, and Genesis Mission due diligence  
- Preserve intellectual history for future collaborators  
- Provide a reference corpus for reconstructing early design decisions

## Current System Location

All canonical modules and live specifications now reside in:

- `/core` — Formal architecture  
- `/modules` — Patch streams and compatible extensions  
- `/consulting` — Deployment and integration guides  
- `/business/market` — External-facing briefs and federal crosswalks  

The archive is retained strictly for historical and forensic purposes.
