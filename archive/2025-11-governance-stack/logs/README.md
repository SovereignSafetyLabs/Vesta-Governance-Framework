# Governance Evidence Log Archive

This directory contains historical model-behavior evidence gathered during the early
research and testing phase of the Sovereign Stack (Q4 2024 – Q4 2025).

These logs are **not part of the production safety system**.  
They are preserved solely for:

- research lineage,
- multi-model validation (MACH),
- drift analysis,
- threat modeling,
- forensic reference for future auditors.
