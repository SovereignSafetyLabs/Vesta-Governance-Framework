# Sovereign Kernel v0.4 — Hardware-Aware Causal Substrate (Placeholder)

**Status:** Draft Scaffold  
**Classification:** Low-Level Causal Substrate (Planned)  
**Extends:** Sovereign Kernel v0.3 (Thermodynamic Kernel)  
**Precedes:** Sovereign Kernel v1.0 (Unified Operational Kernel)

---

# 0. PURPOSE OF THIS VERSION

Kernel v0.4 is intended to define the **hardware-aware causal substrate** required for implementing the thermodynamic and causal constraints introduced in:

- **v0.2** (Runtime Engine)  
- **v0.3** (Thermodynamic Kernel)

This placeholder establishes the conceptual scope of v0.4 without specifying implementation details.

# 1. ANTICIPATED SCOPE

Kernel v0.4 is expected to address:

- mapping ΔS sensing to hardware-level or framework-level primitives  
- causal lineage tracking across distributed inference contexts  
- memory isolation for high-entropy reactions  
- runtime substrate hooks for Proxy Valve and entropy clamps  
- low-level interfaces for secure context purge and reset  
- hardware/accelerator-aware safety envelopes  
- substrate-level fail-closed guarantees  

v0.4 will **not** implement hardware code — it will specify the requirements that an execution substrate must satisfy to host a Sovereign-aligned runtime.

# 2. DESIGN OBJECTIVES

The v0.4 substrate aims to:

1. Provide a stable execution environment for thermodynamic enforcement  
2. Ensure causal integrity survives low-level parallelism and batching  
3. Enable deterministic resets (Blackstop-compatible)  
4. Support multi-agent synchronization at the substrate level  
5. Guarantee that ΔS constraints cannot be bypassed by implementation quirks  

These objectives will be expanded in the full v0.4 draft.

# 3. RELATION TO FUTURE WORK

Kernel v0.4 is the final precursor to:

v1.0 — Unified Operational Kernel


which will merge conceptual, runtime, thermodynamic, and substrate constraints into a single standard.
