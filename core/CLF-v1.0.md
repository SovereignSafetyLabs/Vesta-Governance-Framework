# Causal Link Forcing (CLF)
## Version 1.0 — Deterministic Causality Enforcement

CLF ensures that no output, inference, or permission bypasses the required
causal chain linked to human authorization.

# 1. PRINCIPLES

### 1.1 Causal Precursor
Every allowed action must have a verifiable parent cause.

- forged authority  
- ghost commands
