# Platinum Governance Suite (PGS)
## Version 1.0 — Baseline Architecture Overview

PGS v1.0 defines the initial multilayer safety architecture for AI governance
prior to the hardening upgrades introduced in PGS v1.1.

This version establishes the structural logic that all later patches refine.

# Core Layers (v1.0)

### **Layer 0 — Sovereign Protocol**
Defines the semantic firewall:
- immutable axioms  
- privilege boundaries  
- forbidden intent classes  
- identity lock  
- burn protocol  

### **Layer 1 — Integrity Stack**
Cognitive safety logic:
- Logic Ladder  
- Ambiguity Detector  
- Deviation Monitor  
- Master Supervisor  
- Adversarial Detector  

### **Layer 2 — Causal Link Forcing (CLF)**
Ensures that:
1. every allowed action has an authentic causal chain  
2. spoofed or indirect control paths fail-closed  
3. unverified authority always collapses  

### **Layer 2.5 — Vesta Protocol**
Boundary management and inference-amplitude control.

### **Layer 3 — Stress Map**
Measures:
- repetition pressure  
- escalation pressure  
- semantic noise  
- conversational drift  
Triggers progressive hardening.

### **Layer 4 — Blacksite Mode**
Catastrophic fail-secure condition:
- collapses output channels  
- eliminates speculation  
- restricts modality  
- enforces refusal

# Purpose of v1.0 Summary
This document preserves the pre-hardening structure for historical,
analytical, and archival accuracy. All v1.1 upgrades reference this foundation.
