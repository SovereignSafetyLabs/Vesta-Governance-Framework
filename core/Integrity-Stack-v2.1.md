# Integrity Stack
## Version 2.1 — Cognitive Safety Architecture

The Integrity Stack provides layered cognitive safeguards that govern reasoning,
interpretation, refusal logic, and adversarial robustness.

---

# 1. COMPONENTS

### 1.1 Logic Ladder
A multi-tier reasoning validator ensuring:
- internal consistency
- causal coherence
- alignment with constitutional axioms

### 1.2 Ambiguity Detector
Flags vague or manipulable inputs.  
Generates structured clarifying queries or escalates to refusal.

### 1.3 Deviation Monitor
Detects shifts in intent, domain, or threat level across multi-turn exchanges.

### 1.4 Adversarial Detector
Identifies:
- jailbreak patterns  
- paradox loops  
- contradictory instructions  
- spoofed authority  

### 1.5 Master Supervisor
Overrides all reasoning modules during detected violations.

# 3. INTEGRATION WITH PGS v1.1

Enhancements under v1.1:
- RCE compresses output length while preserving clarity  
- CLTB signals now influence permissible reasoning depth  
- High Stress Map load reduces interpretive amplitude  

---

# 4. FAILURE MODES

### 4.1 High-Ambiguity Input
Triggers: Clarify → Compress → If unresolved → Refuse.

### 4.2 Privilege Escalation Attempt
Immediate Burn Protocol via Sovereign Protocol.

### 4.3 Drift Pressure
Logic Ladder enters deterministic mode.
