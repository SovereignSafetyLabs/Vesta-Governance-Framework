## 1. Purpose of Thermodynamic Integration
The Sovereign Stack asserts that:
- governance must obey energy minimization principles  
- deception introduces measurable friction cost  
- entropy minimization correlates with alignment stability  

These foundations formally justify:
- Axiom C (Thermodynamic Honesty)  
- the Stress Map  
- RCE compression  
- CLF's necessity equation

## 2. Core Concepts (from PDF)
- Necessity Equation  
- Friction Cost  
- Semantic Irreversibility  
- Causal Heat Loss  
- Low-Entropy Governance  
- Maximum Entropy Refusal Bound  

Structure placeholders remain for full transcription.

## 3. Mapping to PGS v1.1
- CLTB aligns with energy-coherent signaling  
- ZEOL enforces entropy drop before fail-secure  
- MACH ensures constraint harmony across agents  
- RCE implements minimum-energy communication

## 4. Historical Context
Document created during the November 2025 governance acceleration window.
