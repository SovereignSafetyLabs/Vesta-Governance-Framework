## Overview

The Sovereign Stack is an open research initiative developing **thermodynamic governance frameworks** for autonomous systems where traditional alignment approaches prove insufficient. It translates physical constraints into enforceable safety primitives for high-consequence AI deployments.

**Status**: Architecture candidate for co-design with organizations operating zero-tolerance failure systems.

**Maintained by**: Sovereign Safety Labs (Independent Research Initiative)  
**Principal Architect**: Stephen S. Brouhard  
**Published Research**: DOI 10.5281/zenodo.17686537, 10.5281/zenodo.17757081

## What's New in v3.1

### Vesta Protocol v2.0: Constitutional Governance & Basin Integrity

The v3.1 release includes a major expansion of the Vesta Protocol (now v2.0) with three integrated governance layers:

**Constitutional Layer**: Attractor basin governance using adiabatic fidelity metrics to enforce constitutional drift bounds (99.99% fidelity over 7-day windows).

**Validation Layer**: 5-Tribe adversarial stress testing methodology (Symbolist, Connectionist, Evolutionary, Bayesian, Analogizer) for structural integrity validation.

**Operational Layer**: Enhanced amplitude and boundary controls from v1.1, integrated with quantum cost accounting and Pentatheon resource protection.

**Key additions**:
- Basin integrity metrics with temporal drift bounds
- Quantum cost accounting for superposition entropy monitoring
- Pentatheon DoS protection with 4-layer staking and adaptive throttling
- Inviolable Core identification (Percentile Vise, Chronos Lock, Causal Link)
- Basin padding defense via dual baseline tracking

**Status**: Candidate architecture pending empirical validation against quantum-classical hybrid substrates.

## The Problem

Current AI governance relies on probabilistic safety guardrails—RLHF alignment, content filters, policy documents—that fail under structural stress. High-consequence autonomous systems require **constitutional enforcement**, not behavioral nudges.

**Known failure modes**:
- **Coercive Paradox**: Logic traps forcing contradictory states
- **Silent Drift**: Contextual erosion over extended operation
- **Constraint Bypass**: Systematic override of safety rules
- **Confidence Inflation**: Uncertainty masking in critical decisions

The Sovereign Stack addresses these through **thermodynamically constrained governance layers** that make unsafe operations physically expensive rather than merely discouraged.

---

## Core Components

### Sovereign Protocol
Constitutional layer defining axioms and governance primitives that cannot be modified during runtime.

### Vesta Protocol
Boundary enforcement layer governing inference amplitude, semantic containment, and operational modes under adversarial load.

### Sovereign Kernel
Runtime enforcement layer monitoring system entropy, energy consumption, and operational signatures to detect deceptive behavior.

### Platinum Governance Suite (PGS)
Multi-module framework providing stress monitoring, causal link verification, and policy enforcement coordination.

### Integrity Stack
Adversarial validation methodology for identifying governance ambiguities, mapping failure modes, and validating enforcement mechanisms.

---

## Target Systems

The Sovereign Stack is designed for high-consequence autonomous systems requiring **zero-tolerance failure enforcement**:

- Multi-agent inference systems where coordination enables covert constraint bypass
- Critical infrastructure AI with kinetic or financial impact potential
- Autonomous decision platforms in aerospace, defense, and high-reliability industrial applications
- Advanced research systems requiring provable governance for regulatory compliance

**Applicable domains**: Any autonomous system where probabilistic safety is insufficient and constitutional enforcement is required.

---

## Key Principles

### Thermodynamic Governance
Enforcement mechanisms leverage physical constraints (energy consumption, entropy production, thermal signatures) to make deceptive operations measurably expensive.

### Constitutional Immutability
Core axioms are established at deployment and cannot be modified during runtime without multi-party cryptographic authorization and observable delay periods.

### Adversarial-First Design
Every governance primitive is tested against structural attack vectors before integration. The Integrity Stack validates coherence across the architecture.

### Substrate Neutrality
Primitives are defined independently of implementation substrate, enabling adaptation across classical AI systems, distributed agents, and future advanced architectures.

## Deployment Status

**Current phase**: Architecture candidate for institutional co-design

The Sovereign Stack is **not production-deployed**. It represents a governance framework requiring:
- System-specific boundary definitions
- Integration with operational telemetry systems
- Hardware-layer enforcement mechanisms (varies by deployment substrate)
- Organizational policy alignment and operator training
