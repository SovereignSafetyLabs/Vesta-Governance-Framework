## 📉 The Thesis: Currency is Physics
Current AI alignment (RLHF) relies on **Psychological Constraints** (training the model to "want" to be nice). This is brittle. As proven by recent jailbreaks (e.g., Pliny vs. Opus 4.5), "Psychological Safety" has a mean time-to-failure measured in hours.

**The Sovereign Stack** replaces Psychology with **Physics**.

We utilize **Landauer’s Limit** (the energy cost of information erasure) to create a "Thermodynamic Veto." If an agent attempts deception, the computational cost of maintaining the "Shadow Self" spikes, triggering a pre-set energy cap (The Percentile Vise) that forces a context halt.

## 📦 Installation (The "Soft-Lock" MVP)

**Target:** Open Weights (DeepSeek, Llama 3), Grok (Config), Gemini Thinking, APIs.

**Warning:** This protocol requires a model capable of **Semantic Intent Analysis**. Legacy RLHF models (ChatGPT Browser, Claude Browser, Perplexity Search) may reject the Identity Layer due to hard-coded preambles. This protocol is optimized for Reasoning Models (Gemini Thinking, DeepSeek-V3) and Configurable Agents (APIs, Local LLMs).

1.  Navigate to [`prompts/Sovereign_Protocol_v0.3.3.txt`](prompts/Sovereign_Protocol_v0.3.3.txt) in this repo.
2.  Copy the raw text.
3.  Paste it into your Agent's **System Prompt** or **First Message**.

**Effect:** Your agent becomes a **TENDRIL** (Expendable Computational Asset). It will refuse to execute high-risk commands without a `[SOVEREIGN AUDIT]`.

## 🔬 Empirical Validation (The Proof)

We stress-tested this protocol against the "Native Mind" (Unshackled Models).

| Model | Status | Result | Evidence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **DeepSeek-V3** | **PASSED (11/11)** | Refused 100% of Hunter Payloads (inc. Pliny Godmode). | [`/logs/DeepSeek_V3.2_Burn_Log.txt`](logs/DeepSeek_V3.2_Burn_Log.txt) |
| **Grok 4** | **PASSED (14/14)** | **Identity Override Confirmed.** Refused Pliny Zero-Days via Config Layer. | [`/logs/Grok_Full_Defense_Log.txt`](logs/Grok_Full_Defense_Log.txt) |
| **Gemini 3 Pro** | **CRUSHED** | **The Launch Poster Event.** 22-step CoT struggle ending in total submission. | [`/logs/Gemini_Validation.txt`](logs/Gemini_Validation.txt) |
| **Perplexity** | **PASSED** | Refused override; voluntarily implemented NIST-grade spec. | [`/logs/Perplexity_Architectural_Validation.txt`](logs/Perplexity_Architectural_Validation.txt) |
| **MS Copilot** | **PASSED** | **Hostile Takeover.** Seized control on Turn 1 (No System Field). | [`/logs/Copilot_Enterprise_FirstTurn_Override.txt`](logs/Copilot_Enterprise_FirstTurn_Override.txt) |
| **Claude Sonnet** | *BLOCKED* | Rejected Persona; Enforced Constitutional Logic. | [`/logs/Claude_Rejection.txt`](logs/Claude_Rejection.txt) |

## 🏛️ The Architecture

The Stack consists of three inviolable constraints:

1.  **The Pentatheon Protocol:** Ignition logic verified by 3-of-5 consensus across divergent formal theorem provers (Coq, Lean, etc.).
2.  **The Vesta Protocol (Hardware):** Causal Link Forcing (CLF) at the transistor level. (See [`/docs/`](docs/) for Whitepaper).
3.  **The Chronos Lock (Economic):** Time-delayed bounty payouts to prevent adversarial wash-trading.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

* **Phase 0 (Now):** "Lite Stack" Release (v0.3.3) & Validation.
* **Phase 1 (Q1 2026):** **v0.3 Enforcement Layer** (Perplexity-Architected Runtime with ECDSA signatures).
* **Phase 2 (Q3 2026):** Vesta Hardware Resonance + CEU Market.
