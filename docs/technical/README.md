# Sovereign Stack — Technical Research Layer

**Exploratory Architectures, Protocols, and Evaluation Methodologies**

> This section contains **speculative, exploratory, and pre-validation material**.
> Concepts described here are research artifacts, not operational systems.
> Metrics, bounds, and primitives are analytical constructs unless explicitly validated.

## Purpose of This Layer

This directory contains the **technical core** of the Sovereign Stack research effort.

It is intended for readers who:
- accept the non-operational research posture
- are evaluating conceptual governance mechanisms
- are interested in adversarial stress-testing methodologies
- understand the difference between architecture and enforcement

If you are looking for a deployable system, this repository is **not** that.

## Contents Overview

### Governance Architectures
- Constitutional governance primitives
- Invariant and boundary-based constraint models
- Multi-layer governance decompositions

### Protocols
- Vesta Protocol (conceptual boundary enforcement)
- Sovereign Protocol (axiomatic governance layer)
- Supporting coordination and validation mechanisms

### Evaluation & Stress Testing
- Adversarial probe taxonomies
- Structural failure-mode mapping
- Long-horizon drift and degradation analysis
- Multi-agent and recursive stress scenarios

### Analytical Constructs
- Resource-cost and entropy-based reasoning
- Constraint bypass modeling
- Basin and attractor metaphors for governance stability

## Interpretation Guidance

When reading technical sections:

- Treat architectural descriptions as **models**, not implementations
- Treat metrics as **research signals**, not performance guarantees
- Treat protocols as **thought experiments and design candidates**
- Treat examples as **illustrative**, not prescriptive

Nothing in this directory should be interpreted as:
- production-ready software
- safety enforcement
- compliance tooling
- operational governance control

## Relationship to Publications

Formal write-ups, longer theoretical treatments, and archived versions of this work
are published via Zenodo and referenced where applicable.

Technical documents here may evolve faster than published papers.

---

## Contribution & Review

This is an **open research repository** under active development.

Researchers interested in:
- critique
- replication
- stress-testing
- or co-analysis

are encouraged to engage, but should coordinate before proposing substantial changes.

> ⚠️ **Reminder**
>
> The presence of detailed technical material does not imply deployment readiness.
> Depth of description should not be mistaken for maturity of validation.
