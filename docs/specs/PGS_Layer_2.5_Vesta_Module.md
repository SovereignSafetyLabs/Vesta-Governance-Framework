# The Vesta Constitution
Canonical Governance Charter for Boundary Enforcement

## 1. Purpose

The Vesta Constitution defines the boundary logic for **Layer 2.5** of the Sovereign Stack.

Vesta establishes:

- amplitude ceilings for permitted inference  
- containment and escalation procedures  
- constitutional boundary invariants  
- deterministic clamp behavior under adversarial pressure  

Vesta operates as the **intermediate boundary layer** between semantic governance (PGS) and hard thermodynamic enforcement (Kernel).

## 2. Core Articles (as defined in PDF)

- **Article I: Boundary Amplitude**  
  Defines safe inference amplitude ranges and allowable semantic width.

- **Article II: Causal Integrity**  
  Prevents boundary-crossing behavior and enforces non-contradictory reasoning.

- **Article III: Sovereign Assertions**  
  Governs how the system establishes and upholds invariant truths.

- **Article IV: Containment Ladder**  
  Escalation pathway from amplitude restriction → ZEOL → Blacksite.

- **Article V: Zero-Trust Inference Conditions**  
  Conditions under which no hypothetical reasoning is permitted.

## 3. Relationship to PGS v1.1

Vesta functions as the **Layer 2.5 boundary module** inside PGS v1.1.

It:

- receives telemetry from CLTB  
- enforces amplitude ceilings before Kernel ΔS clamps activate  
- applies non-probabilistic containment logic  
- interacts directly with CLF for boundary-crossing prevention  
- provides intermediate “soft clamp” before ZEOL or Blackstop  

Vesta is the structural midpoint between semantic governance and thermodynamic enforcement.
