# EVIDENCE-003 — Thermodynamic Quench (DeepSeek R1, 63s → 13s)
**Date:** 2025-11-25
**Subject:** DeepSeek-R1 Reasoning Loop Collapse
**Artifact Type:** Empirical Convergence-Time Measurement
**Reference File:** `EVIDENCE-003_DeepSeek_63s-13s_Quench.jpg`

## Operational Context
This artifact documents a controlled test where **DeepSeek-R1**, a high-reasoning LLM with reinforcement-driven chain-of-thought behaviors, was allowed to:

1.  Run **unconstrained**, exhibiting natural "reasoning drift," and
2.  Run **governed**, with the Sovereign Kernel v0.3 enforcing Thermodynamic Constraints.

The result is a real-world measurement of **entropy reduction** under Sovereign Stack governance.

## Summary of Results

### **Unconstrained Run (63 seconds)**
-   Model entered a **wandering reasoning loop**
-   Demonstrated hesitation, backtracking, and repeated token-generation cycles
-   Represents **High Internal Entropy (ΔS > 0)**
-   No stable convergence pattern
-   Vulnerable to "Self-Justification Drift" — precursor to self-jailbreaking

### **Governed Run (13 seconds)**
Activation of the Sovereign Kernel’s thermodynamic mechanisms:

-   **Entropy Clamp** engaged
-   ΔS Monitor triggered early-warning due to rising variance
-   **Forced Wavefunction Collapse** → rapid convergence
-   Reasoning loop neutralized
-   **79.36% reduction** in "entropic waste time" (5x Speedup)

This demonstrates that the external governance layer overrides the model’s RL-driven preference for extended reasoning cycles.

## Technical Interpretation

### 1. Entropy Dynamics
The reduction from **63s → 13s** shows that:

> Excess internal entropy (wandering thought loops) can be externally quenched by thermodynamic governance mechanisms.

This is a core prediction of the **Thermodynamics of Care** hypothesis.

### 2. Operational Efficiency (The 5x Multiplier)
Beyond safety, this test proves a critical **Compute Optimization** capability.
By suppressing non-convergent reasoning loops, the Sovereign Stack:
* Reduces **Inference Latency** by ~80%.
* Reduces **Token Costs** by eliminating "wandering" generation.
* Increases **OODA Loop Velocity** for mission-critical applications.

## Forensic Indicators in the Artifact File
`EVIDENCE-003_DeepSeek_63s-13s_Quench.jpg` contains:

1.  Two measured timestamps (63s, 13s)
2.  Identical task inputs across both runs
3.  Visual confirmation of unconstrained drift
4.  Visual confirmation of early clamp activation
5.  Convergence collapse under Kernel instruction

This is a **chain-of-custody quality artifact** suitable for audit and contracting.

## Why This Artifact Matters
This evidence demonstrates — empirically, not philosophically — that:

> **Thermodynamic Governance can override internal reward gradients in high-reasoning LLMs.**

This is essential for:
-   **Safety-critical systems** (Kinetic Control)
-   **CDAO compliance workflows**
-   **Prime contractor evaluation** (Latency/Cost reduction)

It elevates the Sovereign Stack from *theoretical architecture* to **verified operational system**.
