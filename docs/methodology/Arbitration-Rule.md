## Rule

When analytical outputs conflict:

2. Conflicting outputs are logged
3. Evidence is requested or the claim is narrowed
4. The human operator selects, modifies, or discards outputs

## Priority Order

1. Empirical evidence
2. Logical coherence
3. Adversarial risk identification

Unresolved disagreement defaults to **non-assertion**.

## Authority

Final arbitration authority rests exclusively with the human operator.
