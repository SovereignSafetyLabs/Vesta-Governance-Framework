# Methodology Overview

**Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED // METHODOLOGY  
**Effective Date:** 2026-02-16

## Purpose

This directory documents the analytical methodology used to structure,
constrain, and review multi-model reasoning during governance analysis
conducted under the Vesta Protocol and Integrity Stack.

These artifacts define **process**, not enforcement mechanisms or guarantees.

## Activation Note

The methodology documented here was formally adopted on **2026-0-16**.

Prior to this date, analytical work was conducted informally.
Historical reasoning artifacts have **not** been retroactively reconstructed.

Beginning on the activation date, forward-going work adheres to the
documented constraints, roles, and review procedures.

## Scope

This methodology governs:
- Use of multiple AI models as analytical instruments
- Role separation and authority limits
- Evidence handling and discard rules
- Disagreement arbitration

This methodology does **not**:
- Assert correctness or truth
- Certify safety or compliance
- Replace human judgment
- Function as runtime enforcement

## Authority

Final analytical authority remains with the human operator.
All model outputs are advisory and may be discarded without justification.
