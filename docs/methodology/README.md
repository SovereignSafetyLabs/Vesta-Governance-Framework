**Classification:** UNCLASSIFIED // METHODOLOGY

## Purpose

This directory documents **how analytical work is conducted**, constrained,
and reviewed during the development and evaluation of governance artifacts
within the Vesta Governance Framework.

It exists to make reasoning:
- Explicit  
- Bounded  
- Reviewable  
- Discardable  

This directory defines **process**, not guarantees.

---

## Methodology Activation Notice

Prior to **2026-01-10**, analytical work was conducted using informal,
exploratory, and evolving practices.

On **2026-01-10**, the Vesta Governance Framework formally adopted a
**node-charter-based methodology** to constrain model use, deny authority,
and introduce explicit evidence and arbitration controls.

Historical materials are retained for provenance only.

---

## Authoritative Methodology (Active)

The following artifacts define the **current, binding methodology**:

### ✔ Node Charters
Formal role definitions and prohibitions for each analytical node
(e.g., synthesis, adversarial reasoning, structural review).

### ✔ Invocation Prompts
Charter-bound task prompts used to operationalize node participation
(prompts may be disclosed selectively).

### ✔ Evidence Logs
Structured records documenting:
- claims under review  
- supporting or conflicting evidence  
- outcomes (accepted, modified, discarded)  

### ✔ Disagreement Arbitration Rule
A formal process for handling conflicting outputs.  
Consensus is explicitly rejected as validation.

### ✔ Human Authority
All final decisions remain human-made.  
All model outputs are advisory and discardable.

## Historical & Conceptual Materials

The following documents are retained for **context and provenance only**:

- **Appendix M — Recursive Poly-Model Design Methodology (Conceptual)**  
  Documents early exploratory thinking prior to formalization.  
  Superseded by the charter-based process above.

These materials are **not authoritative** and must not be treated as
operational standards.

## What This Methodology Does NOT Claim

This methodology does not:
- Guarantee correctness  
- Prevent hallucination  
- Certify safety or compliance  
- Replace human judgment  
- Imply deployment or enforcement  

It exists to **bound error**, not eliminate it.
