**Date:** 2026-02-16  
**Artifact:** Vesta Protocol v2.0 — Industry Failure Claims  
**Node:** Perplexity (Empirical Validation)

**Claim or Question:**  
Do peer-reviewed or primary industry sources support the assertion that
software-based LLM defenses fail at high rates under adaptive attack?

**Evidence Provided:**  
- Google DeepMind et al. (2025), indirect prompt injection defense analysis  
- Gorton & Lewis (2025), geometric superposition vulnerability paper

**Outcome:**  
Accepted with qualification — claim reframed as *documented limitations and
high observed failure rates*, not universal failure.

**Notes:**  
Language adjusted to remove absolute phrasing.
