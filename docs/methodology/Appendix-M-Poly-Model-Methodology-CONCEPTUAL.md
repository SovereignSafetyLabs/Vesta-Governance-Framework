## RECURSIVE POLY-MODEL DESIGN METHODOLOGY (v2.4 — CONCEPTUAL)

**Status:** Conceptual Research Methodology (Pre-Formalization)  
**Scope:** Descriptive / Historical (Non-Normative)  
**Superseded By:** `/methodology/` Node-Charter-Based Process (Effective 2026-02-16)

## STATUS NOTICE (IMPORTANT)

This appendix documents a **conceptual research methodology** developed prior to formal process activation on **2026-02-16**.

It is retained to preserve **methodological provenance** and explain how multi-model reasoning informed early design work.

**This appendix is not an operational standard.**  
**It does not define the active or authoritative methodology.**

The binding, forward-going process is defined by:
- Node Charters  
- Arbitration Rules  
- Evidence Logs  

as documented in `/methodology/`.

---

## 1.0 PURPOSE & CONTEXT

Appendix M describes an *exploratory, recursive research approach* used to investigate how multiple frontier AI models might be leveraged to surface, stress-test, and refine candidate governance concepts.

The methodology was used to:
- Explore adversarial failure modes  
- Identify ambiguity and drift risks  
- Compare how different models framed similar governance problems  
- Inform the eventual need for **formal role separation and authority denial**

The process described here **preceded** the introduction of explicit node charters, evidence gating, and arbitration rules.

---

## 2.0 CONCEPTUAL MULTI-MODEL TOPOLOGY (HISTORICAL)

Early research explored assigning *analytical functions* to different models to probe governance concepts from multiple perspectives.

> **Important:**  
> These roles were *conceptual heuristics*, not delegated authority.  
> Models did not adjudicate, approve, or validate outcomes.

### Example Analytical Functions (Historical)

- **Generative Analysis**  
  Exploration of candidate governance primitives and structural patterns  

- **Adversarial Analysis**  
  Hypothetical stress-testing for bypasses, ambiguity, and escalation dynamics  

- **Structural Review**  
  Examination of internal consistency and long-context coherence  

- **Empirical Reference Checking**  
  Identification of external sources relevant to factual claims  

- **Synthesis Drafting**  
  Consolidation of divergent perspectives into human-reviewable drafts  

Human judgment remained the sole decision authority throughout.

---

## 3.0 THE RECURSIVE RESEARCH LOOP (DESCRIPTIVE)

Early work followed an iterative research pattern:

1. **Proposal** — Candidate concepts drafted for exploration  
2. **Adversarial Critique** — Hypothetical attacks and stress scenarios  
3. **Revision** — Narrowing or discarding weak concepts  
4. **Reference Checking** — Identifying external support or contradiction  
5. **Human Review** — Acceptance, modification, or rejection  

Iterations continued until concepts were either:
- sufficiently bounded for further development, or  
- explicitly discarded  

No guarantees of correctness, safety, or completeness were implied.

---

## 4.0 DEPRECATED CONCEPT: CROSS-MODEL CONVERGENCE

Earlier drafts explored **cross-model agreement** as a *heuristic signal* for conceptual stability.

This approach has been **explicitly deprecated**.

### Current Position
- Agreement between models is **not validation**  
- Consensus is **not proof**  
- Disagreement defaults to **non-assertion**, not forced synthesis  

This correction directly informed the adoption of:
- Evidence-based validation  
- Explicit arbitration rules  
- Human-only authority  

---

## 5.0 ILLUSTRATIVE FILTERING LOGIC (NON-OPERATIONAL)

The following pseudocode blocks are **illustrative only**.  
They are not runtime enforcement mechanisms and do not represent implemented controls.

```python
# Illustrative example — non-operational
def coherence_check(concept):
    return not ambiguous(concept)
```

All acceptance and rejection decisions were, and remain, human-determined.

---

## 6.0 ROLE OF THIS APPENDIX GOING FORWARD

Appendix M serves as:

- Historical context  
- Research provenance  
- Documentation of early exploratory thinking  

It does not:

- Define current process  
- Confer authority on models  
- Establish validation criteria  
- Imply operational deployment  

---

## 7.0 RELATIONSHIP TO CURRENT METHODOLOGY

The concepts explored here directly motivated the transition to the formalized methodology introduced on **2026-01-10**, including:

- Explicit Node Charters  
- Authority denial  
- Evidence logging  
- Disagreement arbitration  
- Forward-only process discipline  

That methodology is authoritative.
